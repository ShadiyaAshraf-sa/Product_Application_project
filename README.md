Product Application is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for managing products with categories and subcategories, including image uploads and dynamic filtering functionality. 
The backend is built using Express, Mongoose, dotenv, cors, and multer, with nodemon used for development purposes. The frontend is built using React, react-dom, react-router-dom, and axios. 
To set up the project, first clone the repository and navigate to the project folder. Install backend dependencies by running npm install express mongoose dotenv cors multer and
npm install --save-dev nodemon in the server directory. Then, install frontend dependencies by running npm install react react-dom react-router-dom axios in the client directory. Create a .env file in 
the backend (server) folder with your MongoDB URI and necessary configuration.Run the backend server with npm run dev and start the React frontend with npm start.
The application allows users to add, update, and view products
